# Libft

This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose functions that are used in my 42 school projects. I will be updating the functions and adding new ones as my studies continue and new projects will be conducted.

## Goals of the project

This is my first project as a student at 42 network. The ultimate goal of recoding the already existing C standard library functions is understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them, as well as learning the C syntax.
